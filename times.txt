48,rotate image, 23:30, went ok a little slow working out recurrence and slightly overcomplicated cycles
49,group anagrams, 05:44, ez pz
50,pow,10:00,time is an estimate but pretty straightforward
51,n queens,40:00,a little slow but it was a hard
52,n queens 2,10:00,absolutely slayed based on feedback from #51
53,maximum subarray,5:00,maybe less very easy dp
54,spiral matrix,30:00,mess on the corner cases
55,jump game,4:00,slayed with greedy algorithm learned earlier
